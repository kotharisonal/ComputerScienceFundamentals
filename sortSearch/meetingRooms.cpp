What We Learned
This one arguably uses a greedy â†´ approach as well, except this time we had to sort the vector first.

How did we figure that out?

We started off trying to solve the problem in one pass, and we noticed that it wouldn't work. We then noticed the reason it wouldn't work:
to see if a given meeting can be merged, we have to look at all the other meetings! That's because the order of the meetings is random.

That's what got us thinking: what if the vector were sorted? We saw that then a greedy approach would work. We had to spend 
O(nlgn) time on sorting the vector, but it was better than our initial brute force approach, which cost us 
O(n^2) time!
